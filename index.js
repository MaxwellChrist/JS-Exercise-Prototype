  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + .eat() should recieve a string as a parameter and take some type of edible as an argument
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach` array.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` array should be empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window/Console binding -> If the "this" is not within anything and therefore within the global scope,
     "this" pertains to the window/console object (unless you're using strict mode)
  2. Explicit binding -> We're explicitly telling what "this" should be binded to. The easiest way I've
     seen so far is by using the .call or .apply bindings
  3. Implicit binding -> The "this" is within an object and when the object calls a function (when a method 
    pertaining to the object is invoked), you look at the information to the left of the dot which calls
    the function (so far it has usually the entire object itself that the method is wrapped in)
  4. constructor binding with the "new" keyword -> you can create a new object with the "new" keyword. "This"
     now pertains to the information within the new object created with the "new" keyword, but uses the 
     constructor function to know which value is what
